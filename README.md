# Leaves Management Project 

This is a Django project for managing leaves.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Install Python:**

   - Visit the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download and install Python for your operating system.

2. **Install pip:**

   - pip is usually installed automatically when you install Python. You can verify if pip is installed by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

     ```bash
     pip --version
     ```

   - If pip is not installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [pip installation page](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

3. **Set up a virtual environment:**

   - It's recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies. Navigate to your project directory in your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

     ```bash
     # Install virtualenv if you haven't already
     pip install virtualenv

     # Create a virtual environment named 'env'
     virtualenv env

     # Activate the virtual environment
     # On Windows:
     env\Scripts\activate
     # On macOS/Linux:
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

   - Your terminal or command prompt should now show the name of the virtual environment at the beginning of the prompt, indicating that it's active.

4. **Clone the repository:**

   - Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
     ```

5. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   - Change into the project directory:

     ```bash
     cd yourproject
     ```

6. **Install dependencies:**

   - Use pip to install the project dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

7. **Set up the database and migrations:**

   - Before running migrations, ensure you have a database configured. Django supports various database backends such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc. Modify the `settings.py` file in the `yourproject` directory to configure your database settings accordingly.

   - After configuring your database, run the following commands to create migrations and apply them to your database:

     ```bash
     python manage.py makemigrations
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

8. **Start the development server:**

   - Start the Django development server to run the project locally:

     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver
     ```

   - Access the development server at `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Access the admin interface at `http://localhost:8000/admin` to manage employees, departments, leaves, etc.
2. Use the provided forms or API endpoints to add, edit, or delete data.
3. Customize the project to fit your specific requirements by editing the Django models, views, and templates.
